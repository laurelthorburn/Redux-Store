# Redux-Store

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description
Refractoring code from one platform to another is an essential part of being a web developer.  In this project, I took a fully functioning website that was using React's Global State and refractored it to [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). Redux was not something I had previous experience with so I relied on Redux's documentation to guide me through this process. Now, go shopping and let Redux do the rest. üõíüõçÔ∏è

## User Story
```
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem

```

<a name="acceptancesection"></a>
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the app‚Äôs store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
